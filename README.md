# Hi, I'm Seela 🧘🏽‍♀️

I'm currently studying at **Hive Helsinki** and working hard to grow as a developer, mainly coding in **C**.
I started my programming journey in **February 2024** from scratch, and I'm excited to see where this path takes me.

### 📂 What I’m working on:
- I'm following the **42 curriculum**, which challenges me to learn through real-world problem-solving and peer collaboration.
- I have all my projects listed here on my profile, and I’ll keep updating them as I continue learning and building new things. 

### 🌱 Growing as a developer:
- Every day is a new opportunity to learn and improve — I’m excited about where my knowledge will take me in the future!
- I'm driven by challenges that push me to think critically and grow both as a programmer and as a problem-solver.
